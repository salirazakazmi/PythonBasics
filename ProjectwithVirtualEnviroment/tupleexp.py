# A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning you cannot change its elements. 
# Tuples are defined using parentheses ().

# Creating a tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

# Accessing elements
print(colors[1])  # Output: "green"

# Tuples are immutable, so this will raise an error:
# colors[1] = "yellow"
